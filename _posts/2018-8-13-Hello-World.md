Hello world! This is my first hexo blog I made on github pages. Very simple and easy to use. Just need to learn the markup which seems easy.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
